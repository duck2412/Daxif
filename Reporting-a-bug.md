# I found a bug
Great! Be sure to try and reproduce it on the latest master branch, such that you are sure it hasn't been fixed yet. If you can still reproduce it, then write a detailed issue which contains the steps needed to reproduce the bug. The point of your description is to keep us from spending time finding the bug, but instead fix it!

# This might not be a bug, but a feature
Awesome! We love new ideas. Write a new issue explaining the new feature in detail, such that you are sure you get what you want.
